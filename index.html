                    Testing was done with two German-speaking users using the website in German, and the two testers were of varying levels of proficiency. 
                    The tests were conducted online via Zoom and Discord, whereby the tasks were on a shared Word Document and the screen was shared to track the users’ actions. 
                    The three tasks were the following (translated from German): </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Tasks
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Task 1: “Look for 3 thematic images you find interesting and add them to a new pin board.” <br> <br> 
                    Task 2: “Make your home feed more relevant and interesting: Find a topic of particular interest to you and add it to your home feed. 
                    Then, remove a topic from your home feed that you do not find very interesting.” <br> <br>
                    Task 3: “Create an ‘Idea Pin’: Search for two thematic and interesting images on the internet or on your local hard drive and upload them to Pinterest as an Idea Pin. 
                    You can make the Pin more interesting, for example by adding a title and editing the image. Once you are satisfied with the pin created, publish it on Pinterest.”     
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    This first challenge is designed around testing core activity users are doing on Pinterest, which is looking for and saving images on pin boards, 
                    while the second task was aimed to test activities a regular user might engage in, such as curating their home feed using the topic feature. For task three, Idea Pins made for a suitable representation of a more editing-heavy form of content creation. 
                    Hence, it made for a prime target for testing a feature for advanced users like content creators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Test
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Task One
                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    For testing, the participants started from “Home.” Both testers scrolled through the pictures displayed on the home feed without using the search function. And, neither of the two participants created a pin board. 
                    Instead, both simply saved the images to their profile by clicking on the “Save” button that appears when hovering over the image.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Task Two
                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The less proficient participant took several minutes to work on finding how to add and remove topics. Amongst the most noteworthy behaviors were attempts to add and remove topics by clicking on pins, particularly the three dots, to try and add/remove a topic that the pin might belong to. 
                    The first tester ended up using the “ignore this pin” function, thinking that it would also remove it as a topic, indicating a misunderstanding of what a topic was. 
                    An additional behavior of note was that the same tester did not use the search function up until the very end. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The second tester also took over 10 minutes for task two, scouring almost all buttons and menus, eventually removing a topic using the “Tune Your Home Feed” tool to remove a topic. 
                    However, adding a topic proved even more difficult. Attempts to add a topic were made using the search function, via pins, via the “Tune Your Home Feed” tool, via adding pins that share a topic, and via the profile. 
                    Eventually, the tester used the Help Center, which at time of the test was very slow to respond, and the action of interest was not found for that reason. 
                    The final route taken was to click on a topic in the “Tune Your Home Feed” section, head to “Explore” and then add a recommended topic from the list. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Task Three
                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The less proficient tester had the most difficulties with task three. For the most part, the plus button was ignored and the user tried to upload images from outside the website, or by clicking on other pins to overwrite them. 
                    Later, the user used the questionmark button to head to the help center, where the information on how to upload a pin was gathered. After about 20 minutes, the tester uploaded a photo as a Pin first, and the other picture as a separate Idea Pin. 
                    The drag-and-drop-function was used intuitively. 
                    However, editing the title of the Idea Pin proved confusing, as interactive text element on the image was not perceived as such, so no on-screen text was created.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The other tester had few issues with finding the tool and uploading the images. 
                    But like the other tester, the transparent text editing preview was not perceived as an interactive element. 
                    The first attempt to add text was done in the text editing section, but the tester was confused about the lack of box to add text. 
                    Once the text function was discovered, another point of confusion was if the text would be transparent on the final image. 
                    Adding a title and uploading the images presented no major issues.
